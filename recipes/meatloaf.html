    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This juicy air fried meatloaf is easy to make in a fraction of the time compared to cooking a meatloaf in the oven. Serve with your favorite sauce and mashed potatoes for a comforting meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 392 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine ground beef, onion, bread crumbs, thyme, egg, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Knead and mix thoroughly. Transfer mixture to a small loaf pan. Smooth the top, press in mushrooms, and coat with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Roast meatloaf in the preheated air fryer until nicely browned, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (72 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Let meatloaf rest at least 10 minutes before slicing into wedges and serving.</li>
